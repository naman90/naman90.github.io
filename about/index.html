<td>2018-Present</td>
<td> Left Fundrecs. For first time I heard Orchestration in micro services. I know micro services and have successfully implemented that kind of architecture,
but Orchestration and Coreography was Alien to me. Received Camunda training and learnt how to model business process and that business process and business
logic are seperate aspects. Spent great time with Jan doing pair programming and Strictly TDD. First time I was working in Agile/Scrum enviroment, 
not totally convinced with Manager's scrum, and the developer's scrum in practice, where i am working, totally opposite to Agile Manifesto. Most 
probably the bowing down to Atlassian JIRA has limited many people's imagination and convinced them it is the only and right way. I thought out that software delivery has everything to
do with <b>right approach</b> to solve problems and not by micro management as mentioned in this anti pattern

Right now I am investigating Java Connector Architecture to refactor the code from Ear to Rar structure.

<td> Working on my own from India after marriage on OCR Engine. Banging my head with severe pain in trying to figure out how to build a solution to read 
images in the code. After long struggle learnt techniques in Computer vision to play with drawings and felt like i can buid paint in the code. While i 
havent build paint, but i certainly did learn how to play with images in a program to extract proper text and pass them to tesseract OCR parser.
